In this round I answered 1 question and did not attempt anymore.

## Problem A -Doggo Recoloring

I stored the characters of my string into an Array in order to compare each character to each other. Then I used a for loop to check if there were any consecutive strings and if there is then I would break out of my loop and print out Yes. If I don't find one I made my program print out No. I submitted and it accepted.
