# Round 52

In this round I answered 1 question and did not attempt anymore.

## Problem A - Vasya and Chocolate

I simply scanned in all my inputs in a while loop to run through the number of test cases. To find the amount of chocolate bars we can find I first found out the number of special bars we can buy by dividing the amount of money we have by the cost then by the number of bars we need to get the special offer to find out the how many special offers we can take advantage of. Then I multiplied it to the number of free bars we can get to find out how many bars we can get from that special offer. Finally I just added that amount to the amount of bars we can get in general by dividing the amount of money we have by the cost.
