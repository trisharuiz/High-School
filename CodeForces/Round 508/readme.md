# Round 508

In this round I answered 1 question and did not attempt anymore.

## Problem A - Equality

I looked through the sample input and output and found a pattern that multiplied the number of times the letter that appears the least appears by k. I made an array that counted the number of times each letter appeared. Then I made a for loop that looked for the least number in that array. Then I multplied that number by the given k and printed it.
