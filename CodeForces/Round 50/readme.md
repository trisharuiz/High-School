# Round 50

In this round I answered 1 question and did not attempt anymore.

## Problem A - Function Height

I looked at the examples and saw that the question is just asking to divide n and k and to round it up. I tried using Math.ceil() but I wasn't familiar with it so I probably used it wrong. When I tried submitting my code with it I got a wrong answer on test 6. With help, I was able to make another way to get the two integers divided but rounded up. I first divided n and k then stored it in the variable x. Then if k didn't divide in evenly with n I would add 1 to x as a way of rounding up. I made an if statement that moded k and n. Then I printed the answer. I submitted and it was accepted.
