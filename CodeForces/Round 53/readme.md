In this round I answered 1 question and did not attempt anymore.

## Problem A - Diverse Substring

I looked at the the problem and realized it was asking for ANY diverse substring at any length so instead of complicating my code all I had to do was to make a code that found a substring of two that had two characters that were different from each other. To do that I scanned in the String first. Then went through each substring of length 2 and checked each character in it. Then I made an if statement that checked if each character did not equal to each other. If it did not it would print out "YES" and the substring. Else, it would print out no. I also made an exception if statement that would print out no if the string was a length of 1 because it cannot be diverse.
