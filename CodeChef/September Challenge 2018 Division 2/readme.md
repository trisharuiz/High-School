# September Challenge 2018 Division 2

In this round I answered 1 question and did not attempt anymore.

## Magician versus Chef

I looked through the problem and simulated the box swapping game on paper. I finally found the pattern in the problem that they wer just switching the position of the coin between the two numbered boxes we input. So I first initialized all the given variables I had to use which was the number of test cases, boxes, the number of swaps, the position number of the coin and the two boxes positions to swap. Then I began with a for loop that will loop through the number of test cases given. Then I scanned in the position of the coin, the number of boxes, and the number of swaps. Then I made another for loop that will loop through the number of the swaps and in the for loop that had if statements that checked whether either swap numbers matched the position of the coin and if it did I would change the coin position. I kept switching until I went through all the boxes. In the end I just printed the final coin position.
